# Language-Identification NLP Project
# Overview
This project focuses on automatically identifying the language of a given text input using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing text samples in multiple languages.
# Features
Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.

Training a classification model to predict the language of input text.

Evaluation and performance metrics of the model.
# Installation
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn streamlit
```
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file (language identification.csv), which contains:

Text samples in different languages.

Language labels corresponding to each text sample.
